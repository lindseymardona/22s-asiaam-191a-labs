                Hello! My name is Lindsey and I'm a third year Cognitive Science student at UCLA with a minor in Digital Humanities.
                My goal as a critical digital map maker is to empower minority groups by enabling more of their voices to be heard 
                and more of their stories to be told.
            </p>
